  <p id="a">Langford was born in Perth, Western Australia,[1] and raised in Applecross, a riverside suburb of Perth.[3] She is the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Langford (née Green), a pediatrician, and Stephen Langford, a flying doctor and director of medical services at the Royal Flying Doctor Service Western Operations.[4][5][3][6] Her younger sister, Josephine Langford, is also an actress.</p>

   <p id="b">Langford began voice lessons with Heidi Lake in 2005, and received classical, jazz, and contemporary vocal training. She was offered a place at Perth Modern School[7][8] for her senior high school years, where she studied music and drama, and was sports captain and a nationally ranked swimmer.[9][10]</p>
   
   <p id="c">Initially during her time at high school, Langford was interested in medicine and politics in addition to musical theatre. In 2012 as a teenager, Langford attended a Lady Gaga concert, the Born This Way Ball, which inspired her to learn to play piano.[11] She shared videos of herself singing three original songs she wrote: "I've Got a Crush on Zoe Bosch," "Young and Stupid," and "3 Words."[12][13] "Young and Stupid" is an anti-suicide song she wrote in 2013 after three Perth teens took their lives.[14] For her final year at Perth Modern, Langford stopped swimming and switched her focus to music and performance.[15] She was successful in a number of musical eisteddfods and drama competitions. Langford appeared in the school's production of Hotel Sorrento in 2013[16][17] and graduated that same year.[18]</p>

   <h2 id="career">Career</h2>
   
   <p>Langford at the MTV Movie & TV Awards in 2018
   Langford first appeared in several small independent films, including Story of Miss Oxygen (2015), Imperfect Quadrant (2016), and Daughter (2016).[16][19] She portrayed the lead character in Daughter, which debuted at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.[19][20] In 2016, after declining the offer from Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, Langford auditioned for Will, a television series centred on the early life of William Shakespeare. She did not get the role.[10]</p>
   
   <p>Langford was then cast as Hannah Baker in the mystery teen drama TV series 13 Reasons Why, playing Baker for the series' first two seasons.[21] When she landed the role, she had only 10 days to get an O-1 visa as she had not worked in the United States before.[22] She researched the role, speaking with a representative of the sexual assault awareness campaign "It's On Us" and a psychiatrist who specializes in adolescence.[23] Several critics lauded her performance as Baker; The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair."[24] She earned various awards and nominations for the role, including a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.[25][26] On 25 May 2018, Langford confirmed that she would not return as Hannah Baker in the third season of the series.[27]</p>
   
   <p>In December 2016, she signed with the William Morris Endeavor agency.[28] She then appeared in her first feature film, The Misguided, an independent comedy-drama by Shannon Alexander, which premiered in January 2018.[29] She also starred as Leah in the 2018 film Love, Simon.[30][31] In October 2018, she was cast in Avengers: Endgame. However, her scenes were cut from the final film when audiences at test screenings found her scene confusing.[32][33]</p>
   
   <p>In 2019, Langford co-starred in Knives Out, a murder mystery film.[34] The ensemble cast received critical acclaim, and she was part of various awards and nominations for the role, which included a Critics' Choice Award nomination for Best Cast.[35]</p>
